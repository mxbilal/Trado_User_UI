> **THE CHALLENGE**
>
> {thisisquestion}**How Do I Become a Funded Trader?**
>
> We believe traders should have the chance to perform at their best,
> without focusing on Time, or unrealistic goals. With that in mind, we
> have built our evaluation in a way that simplifies that path to
> getting funded while\
> safeguarding traders against mishaps, allowing them to become risk
> management pros.
>
> Phase 1: Evaluation
>
> In phase one, you will trade on a demo account where you will have
> unlimited time to pass the set criteria. Here you can trade all your
> favourite assets with tighter spreads but to pass this phase you must
> meet the below criteria:
>
> ● 10% Profit Target\
> ● Minimum Trading Days of 5\
> ● Maximum Daily Drawdown of 5%\
> ● Maximum Overall Drawdown of 10%
>
> Once you have met these targets you will successfully move to phase 2,
> Verification.
>
> Phase 2: Verification
>
> Again with no time limits on a demo account, you will prove your
> ability to build consistent profits. In this phase, we have introduced
> a black-and-white consistency rule whereby traders the total profits
> generated on your best trading day must not exceed 60% of your total
> profit earned. You can clearly
>
> monitor The "Highest Day Profit" parameter, directly from the Funded
> Accounts Dashboard.
>
> Meet the below requirements in phase 2:
>
> ● 8% Profit Target\
> ● Minimum Trading Days of 5\
> ● Maximum Daily Drawdown of 5%\
> ● Maximum Overall Drawdown of 10%\
> ● ***The consistency rule applies: 60%***
>
> Once you have successfully met the requirements of this phase, we\'ll
> carefully assess your performance, and you will then become a Traddoo
> funded trader.
>
> Once you become funded, you will trade on a live account with a full
> STP/ECN broker. Because of this, you are required to fully verify your
> identification. Here you will be asked for:
>
> ● Proof of identification (passport, national ID card, or driving
> licence)● Proof of address (a household bill or similar within the
> last 6 months)
>
> The conclusion of the Funded Account contract will depend on the
> completion and approval of your identification process. Once approved
> you will be able to trade our capital (based on the initial capital
> account chosen at the start of the challenge) and earn an 80/20 profit
> share in your favour.
>
> {thisisquestion}Want to scale?
>
> We offer scaling on our two highest capital accounts, \$100k & \$200k\
> challenges. Prove you can build a 10% profit consecutively for 3
> months and we will increase your account balance by 50%, this means if
> you are trading a \$100k account after 3 months it will have increased
> to \$150,000.
>
> Scale all the way up to \$5 million - THE HIGHEST ON THE MARKET.
>
> {thisisquestion}Will I get a certificate on completion of the challenge?
>
> Yes! Once you have completed phase 1 and 2 successfully, we will email
> you your certificate of completion, so you can show your successes off
> to the world.
>
> {thisisquestion}**How Does the Daily Drawdown Work?**
>
> Traders can have a maximum Daily Drawdown of 5% from their starting
> equity (including all floating losses & profits). The 24-hour period
> starts at 00:00 GMT+3 server time .
>
> For example:\
> If you have a starting balance of \$200,000, 5% drawdown equals to a
> \$10,000 loss. If your account falls below \$190,000 within any given
> trading day, you are in violation of the Daily Drawdown rule. On the
> other hand, if you end the trading day with a profit of, for example,
> \$10,000, your starting capital will increase to \$210,000 and your
> new maximum daily loss will be \$10,500.
>
> {thisisquestion}How do I calculate Daily Drawdown?
>
> The maximum Daily Drawdown is always 5% of your equity at the start of
> the trading day.
>
> It\'s important to note that the maximum daily loss of 5% is based on
> the trader\'s equity at the end of the day (EOD), which is calculated
> at 00:00 GMT+3 server time. This includes both the realized and
> unrealized profit and loss (P&L) of the trader\'s open positions.
>
> For example, in the case of a 100,000 account, if a trader has lost
> \$4,999 on the first day of trading, their equity at the end of the
> day would be \$95,001. The maximum daily loss threshold would reset
> the next day, allowing the trader to potentially lose up to \$4750.05.
>
> Violation of this rule will result in the loss of your Trading
> Account. The same Daily Drawdown applies to all 3 phases (Evaluation,
> Verification, and Funded) of every Challenge.
>
> {thisisquestion}How Does the Overall Drawdown Work?
>
> The capital in any Traddoo Trading Account cannot at any given time
> drop below 10% of the initial account value.
>
> For example:\
> If you have a starting balance of \$100,000, 10% of this equals
> \$10,000. This means if your account falls below \$90,000 at any given
> moment you are in violation of the Overall Drawdown rule.
>
> {thisisquestion}How do I calculate the Overall Drawdown?
>
> The maximum Overall Drawdown allowed is a constant of 10% of your
> initial account size. This means that if you have a \$100,000 account,
> the maximum overall loss you can incur is \$10,000 (10% of \$100,000)
> at any given time, both during the FAC (Funded Account Challenge) and
> after getting your Funded Account.
>
> It\'s important to note that the maximum loss of 10% includes both the
> realized and unrealized profit and loss (P&L) of your open positions.
>
> Violation of the Overall Drawdown will result in the loss of your
> trading account and applies to all 3 Phases of Traddoo's Funded
> Accounts (Evaluation, Verification, and Funded Account).
>
> {thisisquestion}**What are the Min & Max Trading Days?**
>
> The Traddoo challenge has a minimum trading rule. To meet this
> objective, you must trade for at least 5 days during your challenge.
> This means you must open at least one position on each of these days.
>
> {thisisquestion}How do you define a trading day?
>
> A trading day is defined as a day where at least one trade is
> executed. In the case that a trade is held over a number of days, the
> only day that will be considered a \"Trading Day\" is the day the
> position was opened.
>
> {thisisquestion}What\'s the maximum trading period?
>
> We have no time limits to complete the challenge, this means your path
> to funding can be done at your own pace.
>
> {thisisquestion}**What Are the Challenge Profit Targets?**
>
> The profit target of a Traddoo Challenge is set to 10% in the
> Evaluation phase (phase 1) and 8% during Verification (phase 2).
> Profit Target means that
>
> traders need to reach a total profit in the sum of closed trades on
> their challenge account within the duration of their challenge.
>
> For example:
>
> If you choose an account balance of \$50,000, your profit target for
> Phase 1 (Evaluation) will be \$5,000, and \$4,000 for Phase 2
> (Verification).
>
> If you are in violation of this rule this will lead to an automatic
> failure of your challenge account.

> {thisisquestion}**I Have Passed Phase 2! What Next?**
>
> Congratulations on passing Phase 2. Your Traddoo Funded Account should
> be processed in no longer than 48 hours. However, before you receive
> your Funded Account our team will evaluate your performance. To get
> your Funded Account granted, you must have met the below requirements:
>
> ● Met the profit target of 8%\
> ● Traded a minimum of 5 trading days\
> ● Closed all active trades on the phase 2 account\
> ● Have not violated any of our rules & met our consistency target of
> 60%
>
> Once we are happy that you\'ve met all these requirements we will
> grant you your Funded Account with the capital initially chosen at the
> beginning.
>
> Important:
>
> Once you are a Traddoo trader you will trade on a live account and
> therefore will be required to provide the required Identity (KYC)
> documents.
>
> {thisisquestion}**Do I Trade Live or Demo?**
>
> In phases 1 and 2, all accounts are simulated to mimic actual market
> conditions. This means you will trade on a demo account and any
> profits made during stage 1 and stage 2 can not be withdrawn.
>
> Once you have been funded, your account will be connected to a live
> trading account with an STP/ECN broker where you will trade with real
> capital. This is where you can earn an 80% profit share with the
> option to scale and reach an account balance of \$5 million.
>
> {thisisquestion}What is the Consistency Rule?
>
> The Consistency Rule in Traddoo is designed to ensure you achieve
> steady and sustainable profits while effectively managing risk. The
> rule states that the earnings of your best trading day should not
> exceed 60% of your total profits.
>
> The Consistency Rule only applies during Phase 2 (Verification) of the
> Regular Challenge and during the only Phase of the Fast Track
> Challenge. It does not apply to our Swing Challenges.
>
> {thisisquestion}Why is the Consistency Rule Important?
>
> Traddoo's Consistency Rule aids in the cultivation of consistent
> profits and the avoidance of emotion-driven trading. By ensuring your
> most profitable day falls below 60% of your overall profits, you can
> better manage your\
> risk-reward ratio (RRR) and develop a more sustainable trading
> approach. This rule assists Traddoo in identifying the top
> professional traders to fund.
>
> It is important to note that in the case of your profit/loss being in
> the negative, the consistency rule will not apply.
>
> {thisisquestion}When is the Consistency Rule required and how is it calculated?
>
> The Consistency Rule applies solely to Phase 2 (Verification) of the
> Funded Account Challenge. Here, you have the chance to demonstrate
> your ability to manage risk effectively and build consistent success.
>
> The calculation is as follows: Best Day Profit ÷ Overall Profit = Best
> Day % of Total Profit
>
> Let\'s illustrate this with a new example:
>
> Imagine a \$25,000 account with a Phase 2 profit target of \$2,000
> (8%). The daily profit should never exceed \$1,200, which is 60% of
> total profits. Consider this scenario:
>
> ● You reach your target and make a total profit of \$2,000.● You earn
> a \$1,200 profit in a single day.
>
> Result: You do not pass the Challenge.
>
> To succeed, you should devise a strategy that prevents you from
> exceeding a \$1,200 daily profit. Once you reach a total profit of
> \$2,000, you will pass the Challenge as you have demonstrated that you
> can profit consistently without relying on risky large trades.
>
> Here is another example taking into consideration multiple trading
> days in the challenge:
>
> 5 trading days with the following results, day-by-day:
>
> ● +\$1,000\
> ● -\$500\
> ● **+\$2,000**\
> ● +\$750\
> ● -\$250
>
> This results in a total P/L of \$3,000. The highest profit day was the
> day of +\$2,000, so we arrive at the following calculation and value:\
> **\$2,000 / \$3,000 \* 100 = \~0.667 \* 100 = \~66.67% Highest Profit
> Day**
>
> {thisisquestion}What is meant by the Recommended Best Day?
>
> Given that your best trading day should remain below 60% of your total
> profit, we recommend that you set a daily profit target below this
> threshold. This strategy will help you maintain consistency and lock
> in daily profits.

> {thisisquestion}**Are Instant Funding Accounts Available?**
>
> At the time being, we do not offer an \"Instant Funding Account\"
> option within our platform. We provide a range of funding and trading
> services designed to empower traders, and instant funding may be added
> soon. We are constantly working to expand our repertoire and bring
> traders new opportunities, so be sure to stay informed with the latest
> updates.
>
> {thisisquestion}**Do I Trade With Real Funds?**
>
> Once you have passed our 2 phase evaluation, Traddoo traders will have
> the same capital to trade with as initially chosen for their preceding
> evaluation (phase 1) and verification (phase 2) phases. Your Traddoo
> Funded Account will be connected to a [live STP/ECN trading account
> with real capital]{.underline}, an industry first.
>
> It\'s from your live account where we generate real profits, and you
> are entitled to [80% of the profits]{.underline} you earn on the
> account.
>
> Note: We don\'t provide account upgrades, please be sure to choose the
> account size that suits you from the beginning. This initial capital
> is what you will trade on your Funded Account.
>
> If you are successful, prove you are able to build consistent profits
> and have a winning trading strategy in the long run, you can scale
> your account (this is limited to 100k and 200k challenges).
>
> {thisisquestion}What does it mean to trade with an STP/ECN broker?
>
> We want all our traders to succeed, this is why we are the only prop
> firm to connect all Funded Traders to an STP/ECN account.
>
> By offering both STP (Straight-Through-Processing) and ECN (Electronic
> Communications Network), we ensure your order will always find
> liquidity to get executed instantaneously.
>
> Through the STP routing, your order gets sent to a liquidity provider;
> through the ECN model, your order is sent to a pool of market
> participants where it can always find the right counterparty.
>
> {thisisquestion}**How Does the Funded Account Work?**
>
> You will trade with the same account balance that you traded in the
> Traddoo Evaluation and Verification Phases, meaning if you chose
> \$100,000 you will manage a \$100,000 Funded Account. To maintain your
> status as a Funded Trader you will need to meet certain drawdown
> limits:
>
> ● Lose no more than 5% of the day\'s starting balance (Daily
> Drawdown)● Lose no more than 10% of the initial balance (Overall
> Drawdown)
>
> {thisisquestion}How much profit do I get?
>
> The Funded Account allows you to receive an 80% profit split by
> default. If you keep within the drawdown limits and are profitable,
> you will be eligible for your first payout as soon as your Funded
> Account is \$50 in profit. You can request a payout every time your
> Funded Account is in profit of at least \$50.
>
> {thisisquestion}What happens if I breach the drawdown limits or any other Funded Account requirement?
>
> If you are in violation of the Daily or Overall drawdowns or any other
> rule applicable to your Funded Account, this will be disabled. You can
> purchase another Challenge and get funded again without any penalty.
> Please note that you will not bear any of the losses, we take the risk
> of all your potential losses.
>
> {thisisquestion}**How Can I Withdraw Profits?**
>
> Every day, you can request payouts for any profits that you generate.
> We will process your payment as quickly as possible (usually within 8
> hours). In order to be eligible for a payout:
>
> ● Your first payout request can be made as soon as your balance
> exceeds \$50 in profits\
> ● Due to the current market state of crypto, we will only pay out if
> your profit exceeds \$50. This will be calculated on equity gain made
> from the previous payout\
> ● Since Traddoo Funded Accounts are STP, your profits are made in the
> real market (not simulated). This allows you to request payouts at
> anytime, even daily
>
> {thisisquestion}What are the payout methods available?
>
> You can withdraw your profits in USDT ERC20 directly into your wallet.
> Once you have requested your payout, we will review the request and
> aim to
>
> process it as soon as possible (on average it takes less than 8
> hours). Payouts will ONLY be accredited to traders who have fully
> verified accounts and who have not breached any of the Funded Account
> requirements.
>
> You can easily update your payment details at any time from your
> Dashboard, and you\'ll receive a confirmation email as an extra
> measure of security.
>
> Get Paid in Fiat or Crypto With Rise

> account and a variety of other crypto currencies. To benefit from Rise
> payouts you need to onboard with them:

> {thisisquestion}**Can I Scale My Account?**
>
> The Traddoo scaling plan, available on all accounts, not only allows
> you to increase your balance but over time you can also increase your
> potential payout by simply proving yourself as a consistent,
> profitable trader.
>
> {thisisquestion}Why our Scaling Plan is the best on the market?
>
> ● A very generous **50% increase** in account balance every 3 months,
> all the way up to **\$5 million**\
> ● Fair and safe profit eligibility requirement (10% consecutively for
> 3 months)\
> ● Trading goals remain the same\
> ● Profit split of 80/20 in your favor (or 90/10 with the add-on)
>
> {thisisquestion}What are the requirements?
>
> To be eligible, traders must meet a 10% profit target consecutively
> for 3 months, and we will reward you with a 50% balance increase of up
> to \$5 million. If you consistently build 10% profit again in the next
> 3 months, we will reward you with another 50% balance increase, and so
> on.
>
> For example:
>
> If you start with a \$100k account and are profitable for 3
> consecutive months with at least 10% profit, you will qualify for a
> 50% scale increase. Meaning that you will get an extra \$50k, bringing
> your balance up to \$150k. If you
>
> consistently build 10% profit again in the next 3 months, your balance
> will increase to \$225k, and so on.
>

> {thisisquestion}**What\'s The Maximum Number of Accounts Allowed?**
>
> We don\'t limit the number of challenges you can purchase, and you can
> even take part in multiple challenges in parallel. However, When it
> comes to active accounts being run in parallel, each user will be able
> to have a combined starting equity of a maximum of \$200,000. This
> means that, while you can not exceed a total of 8 challenges running
> at once, you will be able to\
> purchase an infinite amount of challenges provided they are within the
> \$200k combined starting equity limit.
>
> For Example:
>
> This means that you can have a total of eight \$25K challenges running
> at the same time. Similarly, you can have a total of four \$50k
> accounts. You can also mix challenges and for example havetwo \$25k
> accounts, one \$50k account, and one \$100k accounts simultaneously,
> however, you will not be able to purchase five \$25k accounts and
> three \$50k accounts.
>
> Please also note that, if the \$200k limit is reached, you will be
> able to\
> purchase more challenges once the ones you have purchased are
> completed.
>
> To summarize, you can buy accounts until you reach a maximum of \$200k

> 5. Tether (USDT-ERC20)\
> 6. USD Coin (USDC -ERC20)
>
> Once you have made your purchase (and it has been verified on the\
> blockchain in case of crypto payment), you will receive your challenge
> account credentials via email. You are now ready to start your
